"""Prompt construction for the Harness VLA beta planner.

The planner is asked to emit exactly **one** JSON primitive invocation per turn,
observe the resulting feedback, and iterate (a closed-loop REPL, simplified to an
in-process loop for the beta). The prompt is assembled from:

* a role + success-signal preamble (Appendix E "Shared Prompt Core");
* the fixed primitive vocabulary and JSON schema;
* the Global Memory (success rules + failure models);
* the current object coordinate table (language-only perception);
* the running action/feedback history for the episode.

PRIMITIVE_REFERENCE = f"""\
Coordinate system: positions X, Y, Z are voxel indices in [0, {VOXEL_SIZE}].
Orientations Roll, Pitch, Yaw are discrete bins in [0, {ROT_MAX}].
Gripper: {GRIPPER_OPEN} = open, {GRIPPER_CLOSED} = closed.

Fixed primitive library (you may ONLY use these; you cannot invent new ones):

Analytic primitives:
  move_to      -> move the end-effector to a voxel target.
                  {{"action": "move_to", "xyz": [x, y, z], "gripper": "open"|"close"(optional)}}
                  xyz may instead be an object name via "target": "object 2".
  rotate_wrist -> set wrist yaw while holding position.
                  {{"action": "rotate_wrist", "target_yaw": <int in [0,{ROT_MAX}]>}}
  rotate_pitch -> set wrist pitch while holding position.
                  {{"action": "rotate_pitch", "target_pitch": <int in [0,{ROT_MAX}]>}}
  set_gripper  -> drive the gripper open or closed in place.
                  {{"action": "set_gripper", "gripper": "open"|"close"}}
  release      -> open the gripper to release a held object.
                  {{"action": "release", "lift": true|false(optional)}}

Contact-rich primitive (a retryable frozen-VLA stand-in):
    vla_act grasp -> {{"action": "vla_act", "object": "object 1", "mode": "grasp"}}
    vla_act place -> {{"action": "vla_act", "object": "object 1", "destination": "object 2", "mode": "place"}}
                                    The object being held and destination MUST be distinct.
    legacy grasp/push -> {{"action": "vla_act", "target": "object 1", "mode": "grasp"|"push"}}
                  Legacy "target" is NEVER allowed for place; place always requires object and destination.
                  For push you may add "direction": [dx, dy, dz].
                  vla_act is retryable: if a grasp comes up empty, re-stage and call it again.

Grounding rule: the visible planner IDs, labels, and roles supplied each turn are
authoritative. Grasp only a manipulable ID. For place, use a manipulable object
ID and a distinct destination ID; never infer roles from ID numbering or wording.

Safety rule: call canonical place only after history explicitly reports
grasp_verified for that same object. action_success means only that a simulator
command executed; it is NOT proof that an object was grasped. On empty_grasp or
grasp_unverified, do not place: inspect feedback, re-stage, and retry grasp.

Division of labor: use vla_act for the moment of contact (grasp/place/push);
use analytic primitives for everything else (staging, transport, release)."""
